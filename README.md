# Simon Game

*Web version of the classic kids game Simon, where the user has to click (or touch, if using on mobile or tablet) buttons in a specific order in order to progress to the next level. Deployed [here](https://eireann07.github.io/simon-game/) with Github pages.

**What I enjoyed about building this site:** I remember playing Simon as a kid at my grandparents' house, so it was very cool to create this site as a final assessment of JavaScript/jQuery fundamentals. 

**What I struggled with while building this site:** Getting the game to progress in levels when the user successfully presses the buttons in the correct order. Initially, my code was really buggy and the buttons would disappear after a user would press buttons in the correct order. 

**What I learned through building this site:** Arrays. If/else statements. Functions. Taking Harvard's CS-50 in conjunction with The App Brewery's Web Dev Bootcamp is really helpful, but this was the first time I really feel like I can see application of the CS principles we've been going over in CS-50 in JavaScript rather than in C, and giving it a front-end has really helped understanding the practical application of those principles.
